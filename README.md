## 🚀 About Me  

I’m an aspiring **AI Engineer / Data Scientist / Computer Vision Researcher**, focused on solving challenging real-world problems through data-driven insights and deep learning models.  

My projects span across domains — from **autonomous traffic object detection**, **transformer architectures for text understanding**, **financial LSTM forecasting**, to **molecular dynamics simulation using LAMMPS and MATLAB**.  

I enjoy transforming complex datasets into practical applications and have experience with the **entire ML pipeline** — data preprocessing, model building, optimization, visualization, and deployment.  

✨ Please do checkout my new blackberry, lime image classifying live web app. It is a bit interesting 😅.
